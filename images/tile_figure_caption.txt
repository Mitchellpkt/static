(Figure caption - comments on bijectivity)

Let T be a Spectre tiling

Let R be any reference tile from T

Let p be the displacement vector and between R and some other tile

Define `B(R, x) -> b` as the rotational difference between tiles R and x, as shown in figure

---

Is the mapping between positions and angles bijective in an aperiodic tiling like spectre?

Does there exist p1 =/= p2 such that B(R, p1) == B(R, p2) ??

---

Impressions supporting bijectivity (by contradiction):

Suppose the relationship between positions and angles is not bijective.

Then there exist p1 =/= p2 in aperidoic tiling T such that B(R, p1) == B(R, p2).

Start at tile p1 and start building out T towards p2.

When we get to p2, the edges either match or they don't.

If the edges do not match, then this contradicts p1 and p2 both being in T.

If the edges do match, then this can be repeated, contradicting T being aperiodic (??????????????)

(I'm really not sure about the last leap in logic. Can a strip of infinite length and finite width have translational periodicity without inducing overall translational periodicity?)
